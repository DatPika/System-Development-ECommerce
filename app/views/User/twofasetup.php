            Please scan the QR-code on the screen with your favorite
            Authenticator software, such as Google Authenticator. The
            authenticator software will generate codes that are valid for 30
            seconds only. Enter such a code while and submit it while it is
            still valid to confirm that the 2-factor authentication can be
            applied to your account.
